Commands crash course
----------------------

This is the good place to start if you know a tiny bit of Python but very little about G'MIC commands.

If you are in a hurry, you may head to the related `G'MIC Python script <https://github.com/myselfhimself/gmic-py/blob/master/examples/tutorial1-simple-filter-and-io/simple_filter_and_io.py>`_ and run it right away after a `pip install gmic`.
