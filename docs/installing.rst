Installing
===============
Here is how to install the gmic-py binary Python module on your OS.

## For Linux / Unices
If you have pip:
```sh
pip install gmic
```

Or conda:
```sh
conda install gmic
```

## For Mac OS
If the library for OpenMP is not installed yet, you may want to install it first (for parallelization speedup):
```sh
brew install libomp # Or possibly clang-omp if failing
```

## For Windows
gmic-py's support for Windows is planned but not ready yet.
