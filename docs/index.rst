# G'MIC Python binding (gmic-py)

gmic-py is an official Python 3 binding to libgmic. It is opinionated and wraps most important things in G'MIC for pythonists. It is written for performance using the C/Python API with a view to support data scientists, technical artists and graphics software Python plug-ins development.
